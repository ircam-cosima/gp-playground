Future Perfect WebAudio developments - October


- OSC (using  control of the functions we are building so some of them could be automated with the HOA score
- To allow layered textures - could the loop number also be OSC controlled?
- sounds triggered and loaded via OSC external to the HTML interface
- hocketting - ie dispersed delays - flocking like speed of trigger (from start) or amplitude (continued play as now)
- Granulation - interpolated random looping function - grain length variable
- Record and playback spatialisation patters which would allow for rhythmic movements across the audience
- DNS - Fu.tu.re
- Tabs for each specified collection of sounds
- Includes looping controls
- Phones show in all tabs
- Allocation of sounds in each tab
- Each phone should receive one of the current sound sets automatically when logging in - and when re-logging in later
- Controller window sometime goes to sleep
- New version - can not trigger sound from phone button in Control window 
- Set phone position using A) user input, B) seat number - could be set in variable
- Make release time a user setable variable so I can vary it from piece to piece - default 8s
- Want to be able to change spatial radius while holding a finger on surface spatializing 

------

Perhaps they could be tabs associated with each folder of sounds so that the sounds are more manageable on the controller page.

Would like to have washers of delayed granulation across all phones using voice samples. Similar to stretched sounds in score. 

Thinking that some of the phone triggered delay approaches in MU might be useful in future perfect.

Would like to be able to trigger all sounds of the same name simultaneously â€“ i.e. drum samples
