# `playground`

## Creating a new project

In the `projects` directory, copy and paste an exisiting directory and rename it.

To select a given projet update the entry `project` in the `config/application.json` so that it matches the name of the directory that contains your project.

The file `project/my-project/config.json` allows to configure the name of the project, the name of the author, and some interface elements such as if audience members are asks to register their position in the room or not.

## @todo

- adding sound files broken cf. filesystem config
- reload when granular is "on" is broken

- configure an image to be used by the `@soundworks/plugin-location` service.
